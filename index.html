                <h2>Hi, I'm Luke!</h2>
                    <p> I am in my final semester pursuing dual degrees in Information Systems and Operations & Supply Chain from
                        the University of Utah, driven by a passion for optimizing business processes through technology and
                        data analysis. My
                        experience includes leading impactful supply chain projects at PepsiCo, where I implemented tools
                        that significantly improved system throughput and efficiency.</p>
                    
                        
                    <p> With strong skills in Python and
                        process improvement, I am eager to contribute to innovative supply chain solutions on a global
                        scale. I am also excited by the opportunity to travel and apply my expertise in diverse environments
                        to help companies achieve operational excellence. (Fun fact, I built this website myself using HTML and CSS)
